Task 2 Completed: Collaborative Design Workflow – ELITE Tech Intern

Thrilled to share the successful completion of Task 2 as part of my internship with Elite Tech Intern!

In this task, I simulated a collaborative workflow in Figma, where my team and I designed a seamless user interface for our app "WaitLess"—aimed at reducing wait times with smart token booking.

Key highlights:

Real-time collaboration and feedback using Figma’s commenting and version control features.

Designed intuitive screens like the Login and Dashboard, ensuring both visual appeal and user-friendliness.

Documented the full collaborative process, from ideation to iteration.

This experience deepened my understanding of UI/UX tools and teamwork in a design environment.
